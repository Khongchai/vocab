# vocab.de-lsp
A vocab file extension

# This is a work in progress

The vocab file extension proposes a specific, human-and-machine readable syntax for memorizing vocabulary.

Eventually, this repo will contains the full specs, the language server, and the _vocab_ to _json_ parser.

For now, the only thing being worked on is the vocab extension for the German language.
